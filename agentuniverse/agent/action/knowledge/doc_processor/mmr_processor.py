"""
Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) post-processor.

Re-ranks the documents recalled by a RAG pipeline so the result set is both
on-topic and non-repetitive. Classic MMR selects documents one at a time,
maximising

    score(d) = lambda * sim(d, query) - (1 - lambda) * max_{s in selected} sim(d, s)

The first term keeps selected documents relevant to the query; the second
penalises redundancy with anything already chosen. ``lambda = 1`` collapses to
pure relevance ranking; ``lambda = 0`` maximises diversity.

This is the *post-processing* direction of issue #248 (knowledge post-
processing components): it runs over the list of documents that
``Knowledge.query_knowledge`` already retrieved and de-duplicated, and returns a
re-ordered (and optionally truncated) list.

It is intentionally distinct from sibling components: ``semantic_deduplicator``
*removes* near-duplicate documents above a hard threshold, and
``ReciprocalRankFusionProcessor`` *combines* ranked lists from several stores;
MMR instead performs diversity-aware *selection / re-ranking* of a single
recalled set.

Embeddings: query and document embeddings are taken from ``Query.embeddings``
and ``Document.embedding`` when present (the store populates them during
retrieval). When an ``embedding_name`` is configured, *every* embedding is
recomputed with that single model so the whole set lives in one space — this
is the only way to obtain a meaningful ranking for documents recalled from
multiple stores that may carry precomputed vectors from different models. A
query is embedded from its ``query_str``; a query that only carries a
precomputed vector is unverifiable (equal dimension does not imply same model)
and the processor degrades to input order. If embeddings cannot be obtained,
the processor degrades gracefully and returns the documents in their input
order rather than crashing retrieval.
